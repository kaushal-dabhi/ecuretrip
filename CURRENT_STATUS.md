---

## 🎯 **Current Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: Featured Treatment Packages Not Showing**
**Problem:** Homepage shows empty treatment packages section
**Cause:** Treatments table is empty (we removed all dummy data)
**Solution:** 
- Frontend gracefully handles empty state
- Treatments will show when real data is added
- No errors, just empty section

### **Issue 2: Treatments Table Schema**
**Problem:** Can't add treatments due to category constraint
**Status:** Table exists but has strict validation rules
**Solution:** 
- Treatments can be added through Supabase dashboard
- Or we can modify the constraint if needed
