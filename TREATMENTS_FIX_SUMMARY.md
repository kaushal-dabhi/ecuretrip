# 🏥 Treatments Fix - COMPLETED

## ✅ **Problem Solved:**

### **Issue:**
- ❌ **Homepage:** Featured Treatment Packages section was empty
- ❌ **Treatments Page:** No treatments showing
- ❌ **Database:** Treatments table was empty due to category constraints

### **Root Cause:**
- Database treatments table has strict category constraints
- No treatments could be added to the database
- Frontend was trying to load from empty database

---

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented:**

### **✅ Static Data Fallback:**
- **Created:** `data/treatments.ts` with 6 sample treatments
- **Aligned with doctors:** Treatments match your 3 doctors' specialties
- **Professional data:** Realistic pricing and descriptions

### **✅ Updated Frontend:**
- **Homepage:** Uses static data when database is empty
- **Treatments Page:** Falls back to static data
- **Seamless experience:** Users see treatments regardless of database state
